# Name Of The Project: Market analysis app for BusMall
## Project Author: Pedja Josifovic
## Description:
BusMall is a start up company that is launching a catalog of assorted high-markup products provided to a captive audience seeking a mental escape from the drudgery of travel. BusMall catalogs are placed on Puget Sound regional transit system buses.

Since catalogs are expensive to print and distribute, the products cost money to make and warehouse, and BusMall is a lean startup that needs to carefully watch its expenditures, BusMall wants to feature only the items in its catalog that are the most likely to sell. This means that BusMall wants to do market analysis on proposed products to test their potential customer interest... before actually putting them into the catalog and getting the manufacturing wheels in motion.

To make this market analysis maximally effective, BusMall wants you to build an app that displays potential products to individuals focus groups (three products at a time), has the group members rank those three products in order of interest, and then store, calculate, and visually display the resulting data.

* When the app loads, randomly select three photos from an album of photos you have been provided by the analysis team
* Display the photos on the screen, side-by-side-by-side
* Have some text on the screen to instruct the user to click on the product that she/he would be most likely to want to buy
* Use an event listener on each photo to track the number of times an individual photo has been clicked; log into the console the name of a product that has been selected, and its total votes so far. At the same time,   display three more random photos.
* Put a 'See Totals' button on the page, only after a user has voted 15 times, that displays a listing of all objects and their vote totals on the screen
